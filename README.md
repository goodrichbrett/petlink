## Project Inspiration

The health of our pets is very important. They cannot communicate the same way we do so it is our responsibility as pet owners to stay vigilant of any symptoms and track suspicious behaviors carefully.

Unfortunately, this is not as easy as it sounds. Some symptoms may go unnoticed if we don't know what they mean, or may only appear every once in a while making it difficult to track any triggers that might be causing them.

In most cases, online articles can shed light on what might be happening with your pet, but wouldn't it be nice if there was a better way to find, or even exchange, relevant information related to your petâ€™s health with people going through the same experiences as you, or with vets that can guide you?
